                My name is Benjamin Brown, I am an 18 year old student at Fontys.
                <br>
                I study ICT and I made this website to show my growth as a user experience (UX) designer throughout this course.
                Although Media design is not my subject of choice, I still want to show I have the base level of knowledge necessary of a programmer in experience design.
                <br>
                The skills I have learnt in this course will hopefully carry over and allow me to consider the user end of a solution during my work going forward.
